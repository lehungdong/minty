<h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
<p>I'm a senior majoring in Molecular Biology. I'm from Vietnam. This is my first time making a website and I'm very excited! I grew up in Sai Gon and moved to the States in 10th grade to attend high school. I moved to Seattle in my freshman year from New York and I've been enjoying Seattle and WA state very much. I'm graduating in June so I'm really looking forward to learn new fun things.</p>
